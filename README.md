# JPACRUDProject

### Description
The project simulates a pokemon game trainer PC regularly found in pokecenters utilizing the fundamentals of CRUD development. The JPACrud project's trainer pc is a database with schema name pokedex. The pokedex houses pokemon entities that are entered along with various details about the creature. The details include thei official pokedex number, pc location id, the type/s, region they are native to, and evolutionary stage. Upon accessing the index page, the user is met with a list of all available pokemon in the PC  as well as the option to look one up by pc location, add a pokemon, or delete a pokemon. Each name links to the pokemon's detail summary. On the details page one can choose to update the pokemon, delete it, or return home. Whenever a user completes a CRUD task they are met with an applicable confirmation page and a link to the home page.  

### Technologies

MySql, Eclipse IDE, Boot Strap, Spring Boot, MySql Workbench

### Lessons Learned
- A good set-up will make or break the rest of project development
- When designing the update functionality I learned the lesson of how to pass a hidden identifier so that the entity being accessed is not lost between jsp files and the controller.
